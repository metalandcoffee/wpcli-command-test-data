# Custom Command for WP-CLI

This is a custom command to generate 10 post of the desired post type. If no post type is provided then it will default to `post`.

Each generate post will contain all Gutenberg blocks in use. A post thumbnail will also be automatically assigned to the post based on what is available in the media library.

## Usage
### `wp eb-test-data --post_type=post`

Plugin must be activated on WordPress install where the command is desired to be used.<br>
